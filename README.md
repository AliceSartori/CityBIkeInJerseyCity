# CityBikeInJerseyCity

## How has the pandemic impacted CityBike?
The vizualizations show how the pandemic impacted total ridership and total trips in the months of March and April 2020. This was probably due to the stay home orders given to New Yorkers and lack of commuters going to their workplaces during that period time frame. 
They also show the dramatic increase of riders in the following months due to the summer season and due to the general safety of ciclying compared to other means of transporations (subways, taxis, uber and lift etc.)

## Other interesting notes? 
  1. There is a higher percentage of male riders than women
  2. There are still riders after 65
  3. Women ride for more time than men
  4. Ridership increases during the weekend
  5. Ridership in JC is more popular near major transportation hubs
